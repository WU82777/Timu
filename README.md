Notes:

The values of x1, x2, y1, y2, fout and out must be expressed as true, false or as simplified boolean expressions.
Boolean expressions may include a single x, a single y and the operators &, | and !.
The values of zr and ng must be expressed as true or false.
Your answers must not include any spaces.
What are the values x1, x2, y1, y2, fout and out when the ALU control inputs have the following values?

if zx == 0 then x1 = 
 , then if nx == 1 then x2 =  
if zy == 0 then y1 = 
 , then if ny == 1 then y2 =  
if f == 0 then fout = 
if no == 1 then out = 
What values would be output on the zr and ng wires if the values of x and y are as follows?

if x == 2 and y == 4 then zr = 
if x == 57 and y == -32768 then ng =
